# Agility.JS
JavaScript Library to facilitate client-side development on Agility CMS projects. Includes helpers for: object cloning, registering JavaScript namesapces, getting/setting/deleting cookies, and generating hashes unique to a particular instance. 

If you are using Agility UGC's npm package **agility-ugc**, it has this package bundled with it already and you do not need to register it as a dependancy.

# Installation Instructions
```
npm install agility
```

## Special Thank You
We'd like to extend a special thank you to Raymond Benefield, for contributing to this package.
